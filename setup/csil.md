Prelminary Setup on CSIL
========================


An overview of the steps involved
---------------------------------

There are a lot of detailed steps involved in the setup.  This table will help you understand the big picture.

If the explanations in the "why" column don't make perfect sense yet, don't stress about it.  There is more detail on the "why" part at each step.    If you are still unclear after reading those more detailed explanations, then ask questions.

| What you'll do  |  Why you are doing it  |  
|---|---|
| Create a heroku account |  So that you can set up webapps to run in the cloud |
| Set up access to the heroku toolbelt on CSIL  |  So that you can manipulate the webapps you are setting up (starting and stopping them, for example.) |
| Make sure you have access to `pip` to install Python addons private to your account | You need some Python add-ons to do webapps, and `pip` allows you to set these up. |


Create a Heroku Account
-----------------------

This part is easy.  Go to http://heroku.com and sign up for a "free" account.    

Make a note of your username and your password.

* You may be asked to share your username with your instructor
* Note that you should NOT NEED to share your password with anyone, not even your instructor.
* You should also not need to save your password in a plain text file at any time.
* You may be asked to type it in occasionally though, so do make sure it is one you remember.
* If you need to reset it, you can do so at http://heroku.com

Unless Heroku has changed something since this was written, *you should not need to enter a credit card* for any of the work we'll ask you to do in this course.   

If you are asked for credit card, then:
* Either you are doing something wrong, or something has changed since these instructions were written.
* That's a good time to check the instructions, and/or ask for help.
