Prelminary Setup on CSIL
========================


An overview of the steps involved
---------------------------------

There are a lot of detailed steps involved in the setup.  This table will help you understand the big picture.

If the explanations in the "why" column don't make perfect sense yet, don't stress about it.  There is more detail on the "why" part at each step.    If you are still unclear after reading those more detailed explanations, then ask questions.

| What you'll do  |  Why you are doing it  |  
|---|---|
| Create a heroku account |  So that you can set up webapps to run in the cloud |
| Set up access to the heroku toolbelt on CSIL  |  So that you can manipulate the webapps you are setting up (starting and stopping them, for example.) |
| Make sure you have access to `pip` to install Python addons private to your account | You need some Python add-ons to do webapps, and `pip` allows you to set these up. |
